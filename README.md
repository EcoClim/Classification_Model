The objective of the notebook is to build a model that helps to classify recycling material, known as EcoIdentify.
---
**After running all code within the Notebook, The model should've saved a file named *EcoIdentify_savedmodel* in my drive. Refer to [deployment](https://huggingface.co/spaces/EcoClim-Solution/EcoIdentify) to learn how to use this file. Similar model was also created using Roboflow. To view this, visit our Roboflow deployment at [Streamlit](https://ecoidentifyv3.streamlit.app/).**
